# HACKATHON-REPO---DART

**COMPLETE THE TASKS BELOW**

**Palindrome Checker**
Task: Write a Dart function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. The function should ignore spaces, punctuation, and be case-insensitive.
Bonus Points: Extend the function to check palindrome properties for numeric inputs as well.
Objective: Test string manipulation, logic implementation, and handling edge cases.
 
**Sorting Algorithm Implementation**
Task: Write a Dart function that implements a sorting algorithm (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Bubble Sort) to sort a list of integers. The function should return the sorted list.
Bonus Points: Implement two different sorting algorithms and compare their performance in terms of execution time.
Objective: Test understanding of algorithmic complexity and the ability to implement and optimize sorting algorithms.

**Basic Calculator Function**
Task: Implement a Dart function that takes two numbers and a mathematical operator (+, -, *, /, %) as input and returns the calculated result. The function should handle basic arithmetic operations.
Bonus Points: Extend the function to handle multi-step operations and include error handling for division by zero.
Objective: Evaluate proficiency in conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and error handling.
